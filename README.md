🏠 California Housing Price Prediction Model (Machine Learning)

This project implements a Machine Learning regression pipeline to predict median house prices in California using socioeconomic and geographical features.  
The model is trained on the California Housing Dataset and supports batch predictions using CSV files, with model persistence handled via Joblib.

 📌 Project Motivation

Accurate housing price prediction is crucial for:
- Real estate analytics
- Urban planning
- Investment decision-making
- Policy analysis

This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model deployment readiness, making it suitable for internship applications and academic projects.

 🧠 Problem Statement

Given district-level data such as income, house age, number of rooms, and population,  
predict the median house value** for that region.

This is a supervised regression problem.


 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset (`housing.csv`) contains the following features:

| Feature | Description |

longitude` | Longitude of the district |
latitude` | Latitude of the district |
housing_median_age` | Median age of houses |
total_rooms` | Total rooms in the district |
total_bedrooms` | Total bedrooms |
population` | Population of the district |
households` | Number of households |
median_income` | Median income (scaled) |
median_house_value` | **Target variable** |
